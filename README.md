# electron-download-manager

> Manage downloadItems from [Electron](http://electron.atom.io)'s BrowserWindows without user interaction, allowing single file download and bulk downloading asynchronously

#### Modified version of [danielnieto's electron-download-manager](https://github.com/danielnieto/electron-download-manager)
This includes a few enhancements that I needed.

- The ability to have a callback for each file in bulkDownload
- The ability to use onProgress for each file in bulkDownload
- The abiity to specify different paths for each file from the default paths
- Pass extra information about the DownloadItem in the callback instead of just the url
- Removed a dependency on request and instead used Electron's ClientRequest

## Why?

- Register global listener that attaches to all newly created BrowserWindow instances
- Automatically download the file to a given folder, without user prompt
- Callback when download has completed (or failed)
- Bulk download: pass a bunch of links and all will get downloaded, with a callback once they're all done.


## Install

```
$ npm install --save electron-download-manager
```


## Usage

### Register it for all windows

Register the listener (that will catch all DownloadItems)

```js
const electron = require("electron");
const {app, BrowserWindow} = electron;

const DownloadManager = require("electron-download-manager");

DownloadManager.register();

app.on("ready", () => {
    let mainWindow = new BrowserWindow();
});

```

### Examples

After registering you must wait until at least 1 window is created to call DownloadManager.download function

#### Single file download from the Main Process

```js

const electron = require("electron");
const {app, BrowserWindow} = electron;

const DownloadManager = require("electron-download-manager");

DownloadManager.register({downloadFolder: app.getPath("downloads") + "/my-app"});;

app.on("ready", ()=>{
    let mainWindow = new BrowserWindow();

    mainWindow.loadURL(`file://${__dirname}/app/index.html`);

	//Single file download
	DownloadManager.download({
        url: "http://i.imgur.com/CuVQGg3.jpg"
    }, function(error, url){
        if(error){
            console.log("ERROR: " + url);
            return;
        }

        console.log("DONE: " + url);
    });

});


```

This example downloads *http://i.imgur.com/CuVQGg3.jpg* file to *user-downloads-folder/my-app/CuVQGg3.jpg*

#### Bulk file download from the Main Process

```js

const electron = require("electron");
const {app, BrowserWindow} = electron;

const DownloadManager = require("electron-download-manager");

DownloadManager.register({downloadFolder: app.getPath("downloads") + "/my-app"});;

app.on("ready", ()=>{
    let mainWindow = new BrowserWindow();

    mainWindow.loadURL(`file://${__dirname}/app/index.html`);

	    var links= [
                "http://i.imgur.com/CuVQGg3.jpg",
                "http://i.imgur.com/ba0urZs.jpg",
                "http://i.imgur.com/69huDpg.png",
                "http://i.imgur.com/ruDR7E6.png"
            ];

        //Bulk file download    
        DownloadManager.bulkDownload({
                urls: links,
                path: "bulk-download"
            }, function(error, finished, errors){
                if(error){
                    console.log("finished: " + finished);
                    console.log("errors: " + errors);
                    return;
                }

                console.log("all finished");
            });

});


```
This example downloads 4 files to *user-downloads-folder/my-app/bulk-downloads*

#### Use from Renderer Process

Once you've registered the listener on the Main process at any time you can call the download function `remote`

```js
require("electron").remote.require("electron-download-manager").download({
                url: "http://i.imgur.com/CuVQGg3.jpg"
            }, function(error, url){
                if(error){
                    alert("ERROR: " + url);
                    return;
                }

                alert("DONE: " + url);

            });
```

## API

### DownloadManager.register([options])

### options

#### downloadFolder

Type: `string`<br>
Default: `app.getPath("downloads")]`

Set a folder where all downloadItems will be downloaded to. It will also be the parent folder for individual folders of each download. Explained below in Download function.

By default, this "root" folder will be user's OS downloads folder
([read about this](http://electron.atom.io/docs/api/app/#appgetpathname))

If the file already exists in the location it will check the file's size against the size on the server, if it is lower than the server it will attempt to resume downloading the file. This is good for downloading large files. E.G Downloading a 200MB file and only 100MB downloaded (app closed/crashed) it will resume the download from where it left off automatically.

If the filesize on the disk is the same as the server it will not download and return a successful callback.

### DownloadManager.download(options, callback(error, {url, filePath))

### options

#### url
Type: `string`

The url of the file to be downloaded

#### path
Type: `string`<br>
Default: `""`

Set a folder where this downloadItems will be downloaded to. This folder is relative to downloadFolder location set in the register function. By default it will be downloaded to root of downloadFolder which would be user download's folder.

#### onProgress(progress)
Type: `function`<br>

A function to be called whenever the file being downloaded progresses, this function will be constantly called with the updated value. 

`progress` float. Represents the download progress percentage. example: `4.637489318847656`

>This feature currently exists only for single file downloads and hasn't been implemented (yet) for bulk processing.


### callback(error, {url, filePath})

Callback to be called when the download has reached a "done" state, which could mean two things either it was successful, or it failed.

if the download was successful the callback's error will be `null`

`url` returns the url of the downloaded file
`filePath` location of where the file is saved

### DownloadManager.bulkDownload(options, callback(error, finished, failed))

### options

#### urls
Type: `array`

Array of `url` strings of the files to be downloaded

#### path
Type: `string`<br>
Default: `""`

Set a path to save all the bulk downloaded files. This folder is relative to downloadFolder location set in the register function. By default it will be downloaded to root of downloadFolder which would be user download's folder.

### callback(error, finished, failed)
Callback to be called when all downloadItems in this bulk have been completed

`error` will be `null` if everything was successful <br>
`finished` is an array containing the `url` of successfully downloaded items <br>
`failed` is an array containing the `url` of failed downloaded items (if any)
